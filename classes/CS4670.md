title: CS 4670 - Introduction to Computer Vision
layout: article
---

## General Information

This is the first introduction course in computer vision offered to undergraduate students. Most students in the class are juniors and seniors but sophomores and graduate students are also found in the class.

## Prerequisites

[[CS 2110]] or [[CS 2112]], [[CS 2800]]

However, I personally found that CS 2800 was not used too often. Instead, some background in Linear Algebra (MATH 2940, 2210, etc.) would be helpful as much of the concepts are founded on matrix operations.

## Topics Covered

 - Image filtering
 - Edge detection
 - Image Resampling
 - Image interpolation
 - Feature Detection
 - Image Transformations
 - Stereo
 - Facial and Object Detection

## Workload

Expect 4-5 projects for the semester, one mid-term, and one cummulative final. Projects are milder than the likes of [[CS 3110]] and are written in Python. The projects do not involve as much coding as other project-based courses. Instead, the projects tend to focus on implementing the theoretical algorithms covered in class. Expect to learn numpy and its functions pretty well by the end of the semester. 

## General Advice

Use the lecture notes for the projects. Most of the projects are implementing the main CV algorithms that are introduced as theory and the documentation for half the projects are extremely sparse or outright wrong. 

## Testimonials

In recent iterations of the course (2019SP) some new projects have been made by TAs. The course staff take forever to grade assignments, and only a handful of UTAs have OH worth going to.
